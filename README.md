# ES-DE-Custom-Systems
Custom systems/collections for the ES-DE themes. The custom es_systems.xml is included. 


## Custom Systems:

- SMW Hacks | ROM Folder Name: 'smwhacks'
- Sonic Hacks | ROM Folder Name: 'sonichacks'
- Pokemon Hacks | ROM Folder Name: 'pokehacks'
- Genesis Hacks | ROM Folder Name: 'genhacks'

For theme specific art, I kept them in their respective folder. 

## Custom Collections:

- Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles | 'tmnt'
- Street Fighter | 'streetfighter'

## Instructions:

Put a copy of the theme that you are going to add content to in your ES-DE/themes home direcory, refer to ES-DE's documentation on where that is for your system. Make sure that you don't have the same theme from the theme downloader in ES-DE. It will take precedent over the one in your home folder. 

The es_systems.xml will go in ES-DE/custom_systems home directory, refer to ES-DE's documentation on where that is for your system. If you don't want all of the custom systems showing up, you can copy the data into your file for the systems you want. Keep in mind that any custom system without art/logos for a theme will usually just show up as black with the name of the system. 

Place the custom art and logos into their respective folder for that theme. 

For custom collections, add a folder in the root directory of the theme with the name of the collection (EG create a 'tmnt' folder for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). The easiest method for this is either downloading the folders that are in this repo or copying the 'custom-collections' folder in the root of the theme and then renaming the copy to the collection. 


I just wrote a quick blurb on how to get these installed, if you want a deeper more thorough instruction set on how ES-DE handles custom content, I *highly* encourage everyone to read through ES-DE's User Manual on custom collections/systems.

I organized the SVG logo files into three main categories:

- Black and White Logos
- Color Logos
- White Logos

>[!NOTE]
>**Not every theme will have custom art/logos for all system/collections**

Feel free to submit a PR if you want to add another custom collection/system with artwork, or new logos!

#Here are some screenshots of the artwork and logos!
