# ES-DE-Custom-Systems
Custom systems for the ES-DE themes. Also, have the modified es_systems.xml for ES-DE.


Custom Systems:

- SMW Hacks | ROM Folder Name: smwhacks
- Sonic Hacks | ROM Folder Name: sonichacks
- Pokemon Hacks | ROM Folder Name: pokehacks

Custom Collections:

-Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles | tmnt
-Street Fighter | streetfighter



I also included alt images/logos for some of the artwork. The file names will be appended with -alt*. If you want to use those, simply rename the file to match the name of the system/collection.

The media is for the themes:
***Note: Not every theme will have every custom system/collection***
You can probably use the artwork for other themes, but this is what it was designed around.
